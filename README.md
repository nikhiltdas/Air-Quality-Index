# Air Quality Index
This project was undertaken as part of my Master's degree in Computer Applications. It involves a compact and portable device designed to measure temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels (in PPM) in classrooms on my college campus. For this study, I monitored the air quality in three selected classrooms and stored the collected data in a real-time database using MongoDB. The hardware components used in this project include:
1. ESP32 Devkit v1 Module
2. DHT11
3. MQ 135
